# QGIS

[QGIS](http://qgis.org/)  is an Open Source Geographic Information System. It took its first steps in 2002, and was soon embraced by SourceForge as one of its projects. QGIS began as a simple GIS data viewer, and has since remarkably grown to a level where common functions and features, but also advanced and robust tools are available for the daily needs of either occasional users and experts alike, in a school, small project or enterprise-level scenario.

For that to keep happening our worldwide community works really hard but also enthusiastically, providing GIS software which is accessible to anyone regardless of their budget, given that traditionally GIS software are really/can be expensive. QGIS not only supports the most popular raster, vector and mesh data formats, with new support easily added using the inclusive plugin architecture, but it can also be used across Operative Systems with ease (Windows, Linux, macOS). Being developed using the Qt toolkit and C++, it presents a neat and easy to use graphical interface.

QGIS is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2 or above. This approach means you, the user, can inspect and modify the source code, so you can always count on having access to a GIS software that is free of cost and can be freely modified to answer your particular needs, without financial barriers.
